# 🛡️ TryHackMe Write-Ups Repository

Welcome to my TryHackMe write-ups repository!  
Here you'll find a curated collection of detailed walkthroughs documenting the challenges and rooms I've completed on the **TryHackMe** platform.

Each write-up is provided as a **PDF file**, containing:

- 🔍 A full step-by-step solution  
- 🧰 Explanations of the techniques, tools, and methodologies used  
- 📸 Important screenshots capturing key moments in the process  
- 📝 Notes, insights, and reasoning behind each action taken  

My goal is to create clear, well-structured, and educational walkthroughs that can help others strengthen their cybersecurity skills and better understand practical security concepts.
